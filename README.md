# Double-Sampled-Multiclass-to-Binary-Reduction

## Introduction: 

We address the problem of multiclass classification in the case where the number of classes is very large. We propose a multiclass to binary reduction strategy, in which we transform the original problem into a binary classification one over pairs of examples. We derive generalization bounds for the error of the classifier of pairs using local Rademacher complexity, and a double sampling strategy (in the terms of examples and classes) that speeds up the training phase while maintaining a very low memory usage. Experiments are carried for text classification on DMOZ and Wikipedia collections with up to 20,000 classes in order to show the efficiency of the proposed method.

## Running Instructions: 

python3 run_script_m2b_github.py [train filename] [test filename] [example_samples] [class_sampling_rate] [Candidates]

Where,
example_samples (mu): Number of examples to be taken per class ( e.g. values 1, 2, 5)

class_sampling_rate: Sampling rate for choosing classes to sample ( e.g. 0.1, 0.01, 0.001) (Note: The minimum value for class_
sampling is set as 1 / Size of class, if user enters less than this value by default 1 class will be chosen.

Candidates (sigma): Number of candidate classes for prediction (e.g. 10, 20, 50)
